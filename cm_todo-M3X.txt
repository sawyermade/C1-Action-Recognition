python pass in confusion matrix 

1. Confusion: check verbs and noun confusions most errors, and most correct: create subset of verb/noun that are detractors. Will show up as verticle line

Top 10-20 of each: Possible reorder classes to most frequent/correct/wrong
2. Subset of really bad verb/nouns.

3. Subset of middle verb/nouns.

4. Subset of best verb/nouns.

5. Ignore tail verb/noun

6. histogram of verb/noun classes for occurances in validation

7. possible heatmap

8. How many errors are in tails and percentage of dominant/worst tails.

9. With all tails right, how well does it improve overall performance and is it worth.

10. Slides for presentation with all information

11. positional encoding for noun

12. data balance and focal loss, count occurences of class/noun/verbs weight based on freq and normalize weight.
